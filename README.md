Just me doing research assistant work and learning Ruby at the same time. It is easier to clone for myself when it is public. 

todo 
- [ ] decide on Carriage Return + Line Feed autoclrf, probably nothing
- [ ] chomp newline on input
- [ ] automatically detect if clocked in or out

timesheet is mostly functional I'm just learning ruby by building it until I can ask datavyu questions
